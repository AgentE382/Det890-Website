<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Q: If I join Air Force ROTC, does that mean that I am joining the military?</h4>

<p>Just joining Air Force ROTC does not mean you are joining the military; only
after receiving a three-year scholarship or starting the second year of a four-year
scholarship will obligate you to military service.</p>

<h4>Q: If I apply for a scholarship, am I obligated to do ROTC if I should be accepted?</h4>

<p>If your scholarship is accepted, you still retain the right to refuse it. For example,
if you receive a scholarship from both Army ROTC and Air Force ROTC, you can
refuse one scholarship while accepting another. This being said, there is a deadline
for accepting an AFROTC scholarship.</p>

<h4>Q: How does receiving my stipend work?</h4>

<p>A: After receiving an AFROTC scholarship, stipend payments will be divided into two
monthly payments. The cadet can choose to receive a check, or apply for a direct
deposit into his or her respective banking account. Payments will come in during
the school year, and will not carry over into breaks. In other words, if you are not at
school, you are not getting a stipend.</p>

<h4>Q: What is the commute from LU to UVA like? And how well do ROTC and normal
school work together?</h4>

<p>A: The commute from LU to UVA is not difficult, as the trip is made once a week. We
are fortunate enough to have a high class charter bus for the commute that Liberty
University has provided the cadets. The commute can be seen as beneficial as it
gives cadets time to interact with one another in a relaxed environment. ROTC and
normal school essentially work together hand in hand. The balance can be difficult to
find at first, but gets easier once you fully adjust to it.</p>

<h4>Q: How will joining Air Force ROTC on a scholarship affect my future after I finish
college?</h4>

<p>A: The good thing about joining Air Force ROTC on scholarship is that you can
potentially finish college debt-free. On scholarship, the need for taking out student
loans decreases significantly, as tuition is covered, books are paid for, and other
school-related expenses are taken care of. Being on scholarship through Air
Force ROTC is a great way to leave college without having to pay off educational
expenses once you graduate.</p>

<h4>Q: Who is eligible to participate in AFROTC?</h4>

<p>A: Factors that determine AFROTC eligibility are that the student must be:</p>

a. Enrolled in a university that has an Air Force ROTC detachment, or crosstown
agreement

b. United States citizen

c. Good physical condition (meets weigh standards)- chart available on afrotc.com

d. Attend Aerospace studies courses as well as Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) each
semester

e. Meets age requirements (Must graduate and commission by the age of 30)

f. Good moral character

<h4>Q: What majors are available through an AFROTC scholarship and can each
scholarship be applied to every university?</h4>

<p>A: There are two types of majors that an AFROTC scholarship can cover: Technical
and Non-Technical. Specific majors that fall under each category can be found
at http://afrotc.com/scholarships/high-school/scholarship-types/. Since Detachment
890 is made up of five schools, it is important to make sure that the scholarship you
are looking into and the majors offered at each school match up.</p>

<h4>Q: How much time will Air Force ROTC require from me?</h4>

<p>A: Initially, it will be 5 hrs per week: 2 hours of Physical Training, 2 hours of
Leadership Laboratory, and a 1-credit class (for your first two years). However, 
there are optional events that will benefit you such as optional PT and drill practice,
but these are not mandatory. As you progress through the program and your
responsibility increases, your involvement will demand more time, but not to the
point where it will interfere with your school work.</p>

<h4>Q: How often are we required to wear our uniform?</h4>

<p>A: We wear our uniforms once a week on Tuesdays until we are dismissed from
Leadership Laboratory as well as twice a week to PT.</p>

<h4>Q: If I did not receive a scholarship before joining the program, can I get one while
enrolled?</h4>

<p>A: Unlike high school scholarships, which involve an application, the Detachment
Commander gives in-college scholarships as the Air Force sees fit. Most of these
scholarships are given to students studying engineering, nursing, or a critical
language.</p>

<h4>Q: What do you do in Leadership Lab and are there any other mandatory classes?</h4>

<p>A: Leadership Laboratory is a two-hour lab where the entire Corps participates in
leadership development training. It is led by senior cadet leadership to benefit the
underclassmen. Past events have included: guest speakers, drill practice, small
unit tactics training, and visits to the gun range and ropes course. The only other
mandatory class is the 1-credit class for underclassmen about Air Force history
and the ROTC program, and the upperclassmen's 3-credit course on today's Air
Force and leadership development. These are held every semester and are taught
by a current Air Force officer.</p>
