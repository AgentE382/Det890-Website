<h2>About Detachment 890</h2>

<p>Air Force ROTC Detachment 890 was founded at the University of 
Virginia in 1951. From the moment of its conception, Detachment 890 
has enjoyed the historic setting of this prestigious university. 
The detachment was originally headquartered in Varsity Hall - one 
of the University's oldest buildings. Varsity Hall first served as 
the school's infirmary in 1858 and was later repurposed as a Civil 
War hospital a few years later. In 2004, the detachment shifted its 
main operating location to the Astronomy building to allow workers 
to restore the building and have remained there since.</p>

<p>Currently, Detachment 890 is recognized as one of the preeminent 
detachments in the Southeast region. Cadets from all three schools 
that now comprise the Cadet Corps, James Madison University, Liberty 
University, and the University of Virginia, consistently beat national 
GPA and physical training averages. Det. 890 has earned numerous accolades 
over the past decade, including multiple awards of the Virginia Air 
Force Association Award for Excellence and the Southeast Region 
Outstanding AFROTC Unit Award.</p>

<p>Not only is the detachment successful on a large scale, but each 
cadet is also driven to succeed individually. Each year, detachments 
across the nation send cadets to a summer boot camp known as "Field 
Training." Cadets from Det 890 consistently place in the top third of 
their flights, earning accolades such as Distinguished Graduate, Superior 
Performer, and Expert Marksman.</p>

<p>We continue to meet and exceed the impressive accomplishments of the 
detachment in the 61 years it has been active. We will continue to strive 
to not only be the best detachment in the South East Region, but also 
in the nation. We will continue to produce Air Force officers of the 
highest caliber. Without a doubt, we will remain one of the Air Force's 
premier training environments for future Air Force officers.</p>
