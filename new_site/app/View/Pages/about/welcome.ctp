<h3>Commander's Welcome</h3>

<p>Welcome to AFROTC Detachment 890 at the University of Virginia, where our mission is to develop
quality leaders for the Air Force. The Reserve Officer Training Corps, through intense training and
course work, opens the door for entry into the world's finest Air Force. Our cadets have gone on to serve
in a range of career fields, including aviation, special operations, engineering, support, medical, and
special investigations. Through a cross-town arrangement, cadets at Liberty University, James Madison
University, and Piedmont Virginia Community College also participate in our program.</p>

<p>We offer cadets an ideal training environment that instills the core values of integrity, service, and
excellence that fosters leaders of character and discipline. These values, coupled with the surroundings
of large, accredited universities, produce the type of well-rounded officers the Air Force is seeking.
Cadets are exposed to numerous fun and challenging activities and programs, along with organizations
that reach out to the local community. This strengthens the skills necessary to benefit their careers in the
military.</p>

<p>We offer scholarships for a range of academic programs, open to both high school and college students
who excel in academics and display superior leadership potential. We are excited about your interest
in AFROTC Detachment 890 and look forward to assisting you on your flight into the United States Air
Force.</p>
