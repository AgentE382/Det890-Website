<h2>About Detachment 890</h2>

<p>AFROTC Detachment 890 was founded at the University of Virginia in
1951. Since then, Det. 890 has continued a tradition of excellence by
commissioning outstanding officers and winning many national, state,
and individual awards. The Cadet Corps has been presented with the
Virginia Air Force Association Award for excellence two times and won
the Southeast Region Outstanding AFROTC Unit Award.</p>

<p>From 1951 to spring 2004, historic Varsity Hall served as the
detachment's headquarters and classrooms. The building is one of the
oldest on Grounds. It was built as the University's infirmary in 1858
and used as a hospital during the Civil War. In fall 2004, the entire
building was moved a few hundred feet by Expert House movers, the same
firm that moved the Cape Hatteras lighthouse in 1999. To allow the
University to perform the move and make restorations, the detachment's
facilities moved to the Astronomy Building, located on the corner of
McCormick and Alderman Roads. The University's Astronomy building now
serves as Detachment 890's permanent headquarters and classroom.</p>

<p>Detachment 890 is now recognized as the preeminent detachment of
the AFROTC South East region. Our cadets ranked in the top 10 for
the nation last year in physical fitness with an average Physical
Fitness Assessment Score of just over 97%. The detachment returned 31
graduates from field training this past summer and received numerous
awards. Among those returning: Two Top Guns, two Distinguished
Graduates, a Superior Performer, a Cadet Training Assistant as well
as many others in the Top Third. This past Spring, Detachment 890's
Drill Team received first place for Exhibition Rifle Routine at the
annual Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute tournament.</p>

<p>We continue to strive to meet and exceed the accomplishments earned
by the cadets of the past 61 years. Our detachment will continue
the push to be not only the preeminent detachment of the South East
region, but the preeminent detachment across our entire nation. As
our detachment moves forward, we will remain one of the Air Force's
premier sources for commission and produce its finest officers.</p>
